        A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order.
        <br>
        It follows the principle of "First in, First out" (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
        It is used as a buffer in computer systems where we have speed mismatch between two devices that communicate with each other. For example, CPU and keyboard and two devices in a network
        Queue is also used in Operating System algorithms like CPU Scheduling and Memory Management, and many standard algorithms like Breadth First Search of Graph, Level Order Traversal of a Tree.
