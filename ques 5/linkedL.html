        A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. Hereâ€™s the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays
        <br>
        Linked List:
        <br>
        Data Structure: Non-contiguous
        Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
        Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
        Access: Sequential
        Array:
        <br>
        Data Structure: Contiguous
        Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
        Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
        Access: Random
        Basics of Linked List:
        Singly Linked List
        Doubly Linked List
        Circular Linked List
        Applications and Advantages of Linked List
        Operations of Linked Lists:
        Length of Linked List
        Print Linked List
        Linked List Insertion
        Search in a Linked List
        Deleting a given key
        Deleting at given position
        Delete a Linked List
        Nth Node from Start
        Nth Node from End
        Size of Doubly Linked List
