    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Stack</h1>
    <p>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations:
        <br>
        Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
        Pop, which removes the most recently added element.
        Additionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name stack is an analogy to a set of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates.
        <br>
        The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out, referred to by the acronym LIFO.[nb 1] As with a stack of physical objects, this structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, but accessing a datum deeper in the stack may require removing multiple other items first.
