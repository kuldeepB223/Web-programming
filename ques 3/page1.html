    <h3>Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a fundamental concept in Java that every developer must understand. 
        It allows developers to structure code using classes and objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable. 
        The core idea of OOPs is to bind data and the functions that operate on it, preventing unauthorized access from other parts of the code. 
        Java strictly follows the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) Principle, ensuring that common logic is written once and reused throughout the application.
