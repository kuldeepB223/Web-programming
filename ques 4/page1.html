    <h3>Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a fundamental concept in Java that every developer must understand. <br/>
        It allows developers to structure code using classes and objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable. <br/>
        The core idea of OOPs is to bind data and the functions that operate on it, preventing unauthorized access from other parts of the code. <br/>
        Java strictly follows the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) Principle, ensuring that common logic is written once and reused throughout the application.<br/>
